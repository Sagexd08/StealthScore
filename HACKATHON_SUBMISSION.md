## 🎯 Real-World Impact

### Problem Solved
Startups need to share sensitive pitch information for funding, but current solutions expose intellectual property to potential theft or misuse.

### Solution
PitchGuard enables secure pitch evaluation through:
1. **Client-side encryption** before data leaves the device
2. **TEE processing** for secure computation
3. **Federated learning** for collaborative improvement
4. **ZK proofs** for verification without exposure
